- I'm working on posting more of my thoughts on the internet
- I've got 2 degrees from UBC in history, economics and computer science
- I'm interested in the intersection of technology, society and human cognition

This site was built thanks to [Beautiful Jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/), [markdown](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). As with most things in tech, I'm in debt to those who came before me and open-sourced their work.
